    When we were looking for a Q&A application, Ask for the moon stood out by offering a people-centric approach. It allowed us to address several key aspects of our KM program with one application.<br/><br/>
    In addition, to get past the investment stage, the system for objectively evaluating the Return On Investment was decisive.
